## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before tasks generation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists and look for `hooks.before_tasks`
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`
- For each executable hook: show optional ones for manual execution; auto-execute mandatory ones and wait for result
- If no hooks or file missing, skip silently

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-tasks.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR, TASKS_TEMPLATE, and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. `FEATURE_DIR` and `TASKS_TEMPLATE` must be absolute paths.

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (interface contracts), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map interface contracts to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Validate task completeness (each user story independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use TASKS_TEMPLATE (or fallback to `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`) with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format below

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md with total task count, count per user story, parallel opportunities, and suggested MVP scope.

6. **Check for extension hooks** after generation (look for `hooks.after_tasks` in `.specify/extensions.yml`).

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]`
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only (e.g., [US1], [US2])
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:
- ✅ `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ❌ `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites — MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
